## The Pieces

<img src="./docs/images/NorseMythologyLeadsToPostgres.png" width=720 />

* **Database:** Any postgres database will work.  In `deploy/`, cockroachdb is 
  used.  The services connect to the database using the [codex-db](https://github.com/xmidt-org/codex-db) 
  library.
* **[Svalinn](https://github.com/xmidt-org/svalinn):** Registers to an 
  endpoint to receive events (Optional).  Has an endpoint that receives events
  as [WRP Messages](https://github.com/xmidt-org/wrp-c/wiki/Web-Routing-Protocol),
  parses them, and inserts them into the database.
* **[Gungnir](https://github.com/xmidt-org/gungnir):** Has endpoints that 
  provide device information from the database.
* **[Fenrir](https://github.com/xmidt-org/fenrir):** Deletes old records 
  from the database at an interval.
* **[Heimdall](https://github.com/xmidt-org/heimdall):** A consumer of Codex (sends requests to Gungnir) but also requests directly to the database to get a list of device IDs.
